    "### **Module 7 Summary: File I/O (Input and Output)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This module covers how to make your Python programs interact with files on your computer, allowing you to read data (Input) and save results (Output). This is a fundamental skill for any data-related work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Working with Plain Text Files (`.txt`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of all file operations is the `open()` function, which is best used within a `with` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **The `with open()` Statement: The Pythonic Way**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `with` statement creates a \"context\" that guarantees a resource is properly managed. For files, it ensures the file is **automatically closed** after the indented block is finished, even if errors occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('my_file.txt', 'w') as f:\n",
    "    # 'f' is the variable representing the open file object.\n",
    "    # All file operations happen inside this indented block.\n",
    "    f.write(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "# Once the code un-indents here, f.close() has been called automatically.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **ðŸ’¡ Python Fact & Nuance (Context Managers):**\n",
    "> The `with` statement is a general-purpose tool for managing any resource that needs setup and cleanup (like database connections or network sockets), not just files. Any object that has `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods can be used in a `with` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **File Modes**\n",
    "\n",
    "The second argument to `open()` specifies the mode. The three most common are:\n",
    "*   `'r'` - **Read Mode:** The default mode. Used to read data from an existing file. Raises `FileNotFoundError` if the file doesn't exist.\n",
    "*   `'w'` - **Write Mode:** Used to write data to a file. **Warning:** If the file exists, its content is **completely erased**. If it doesn't exist, it's created.\n",
    "*   `'a'` - **Append Mode:** Used to add new data to the *end* of an existing file. If the file doesn't exist, it's created. This mode does not erase existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Writing to a File**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `.write()` or `.writelines()` methods. You must manually add newline characters (`\\n`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lines_to_add = [\"First line.\\n\", \"Second line.\\n\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "with open('my_log.txt', 'a') as f:\n",
    "    f.write(\"This is a single entry.\\n\")\n",
    "    f.writelines(lines_to_add)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Reading from a File**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to read, but one is highly preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `file.read()`: Reads the *entire* file into a single string. **Warning:** Avoid this for large files as it can consume a lot of memory.\n",
    "*   `file.readlines()`: Reads the *entire* file into a list of strings. **Warning:** Also memory-intensive for large files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practice: Iterating Directly Over the File Object**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most memory-efficient and Pythonic way to read a file line-by-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    with open('my_log.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
    "        print(\"--- Log Entries ---\")\n",
    "        # The file object 'f' is an iterator.\n",
    "        # Python reads only one line into memory at a time.\n",
    "        for line in f:\n",
    "            # .strip() removes leading/trailing whitespace, including the invisible '\\n'\n",
    "            print(line.strip())\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print(\"Log file does not exist yet.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **ðŸ’¡ Python Fact & Nuance (Iterators):**\n",
    "> An iterator is an object that allows you to traverse through all its elements, one at a time, without loading them all into memory at once. File objects are natural iterators, which makes them highly efficient for processing large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Working with Structured Data (CSV Files)**\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a standard format for tabular data. Python's built-in `csv` module is the right tool for this job.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Reading CSV Files with the `csv` Module**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `csv.DictReader` is the most convenient way to read a CSV. It treats each row as a dictionary, using the first row (header) as the keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Given a file `data.csv`:\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "name,city,age\n",
    "Alice,New York,28\n",
    "Bob,London,35\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You would read it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import csv\n",
    "\n",
    "filename = 'data.csv'\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    with open(filename, 'r', newline='') as csvfile:\n",
    "        # DictReader turns each row into a dictionary.\n",
    "        reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        for row in reader:\n",
    "            # 'row' is a dictionary, e.g., {'name': 'Alice', 'city': 'New York', 'age': '28'}\n",
    "            name = row['name']\n",
    "            age_str = row['age']\n",
    "            \n",
    "            # You must manually convert data types!\n",
    "            age = int(age_str)\n",
    "            print(f\"{name} is {age} years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print(f\"File not found: {filename}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **ðŸ’¡ Key Points for `csv.DictReader`:**\n",
    "> 1.  **Everything is a String:** All values read from a CSV are initially strings. You are responsible for converting them to `int`, `float`, etc., if you need to perform calculations.\n",
    "> 2.  **`newline=''`:** This argument in `open()` is crucial when working with the `csv` module. It prevents issues with how different operating systems handle line endings, which can otherwise result in blank rows being read.\n",
    "> 3.  **Readability:** Using `csv.DictReader` makes your code much more readable and robust than manually splitting lines. Accessing data by column name (`row['age']`) is far better than by index (`row[2]`).\n"
