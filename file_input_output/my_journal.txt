Today I learned File I/O.
But something unusual happened, i had already done the write, append and read modes and done a log_events task.
In this task I had to record the logs with the timestamp using the datetime module.
I successfully did the task and also the bonus challenge.
Then gemini pro was teaching me about how we can iterate over the file object, which is a more memory efficient way.
I was about to ask him a few questions and suddenly the tab got closed and the memory was lost!
Then I had to open the tab again and do the whole thing again and here I am now..
Yo Gemini!, should I send you my log.app task too? What do you say?
