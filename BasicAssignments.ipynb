    "## Assignment 1: Student Grade Analyzer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective: Write a Python program that takes marks for multiple subjects from a student, calculates the total, average, and assigns a grade.\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "### -Ask the user to input the number of subjects.\n",
    "### -For each subject, ask the user to input the name of the subject and the marks obtained (out of 100). Store these (perhaps in a list of dictionaries or a dictionary).\n",
    "### -Calculate the total marks obtained and the overall percentage.\n",
    "### -Assign a grade based on the percentage:\n",
    "###    -90% and above: Grade A\n",
    "###    -80% - 89%: Grade B\n",
    "###    -70% - 79%: Grade C\n",
    "###    -60% - 69%: Grade D\n",
    "###    -Below 60%: Grade F\n",
    "### -Display the subject-wise marks, total marks, overall percentage (formatted to 2 decimal places), and the final grade.\n",
    "### -Concepts Tested: User input, loops (for and/or while), data structures (lists, dictionaries), arithmetic operations, conditional statements (if/elif/else), string formatting."
