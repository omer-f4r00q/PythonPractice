    "### Requirements:\n",
    "### -Ask the user to input the number of subjects.\n",
    "### -For each subject, ask the user to input the name of the subject and the marks obtained (out of 100). Store these (perhaps in a list of dictionaries or a dictionary).\n",
    "### -Calculate the total marks obtained and the overall percentage.\n",
    "### -Assign a grade based on the percentage:\n",

    "###    -Below 60%: Grade F\n",
    "### -Display the subject-wise marks, total marks, overall percentage (formatted to 2 decimal places), and the final grade.\n",
